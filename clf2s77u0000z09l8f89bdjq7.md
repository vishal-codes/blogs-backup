Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are changing the way users interact with the web. They offer the benefits of a native app while running on the browser, providing a seamless and immersive experience. One of the key features of PWAs is the ability to install them on a user's device, making them accessible with a single click from the home screen or app drawer.

While the default install prompt for PWAs is functional, it may not always align with the branding or design of your app or website. A custom install prompt can help to create a cohesive user experience and encourage users to install your app. In this blog post, we will explore the benefits of custom install prompts, the steps to create one, and best practices to optimize user engagement.

### Benefits of Custom Install Prompts üåü

The default install prompt for PWAs is triggered by the browser when it detects that the app is installable. On mobile devices, the prompt appears at the bottom of the screen and offers users the option to `Add to Home Screen`. While this prompt is functional, it may not always capture the user's attention or convey the value of the app. Custom install prompts offer several benefits over the default prompt:

1. **Customization**üé®: Custom install prompts allow developers to tailor the prompt to match the style of their app or website. By customizing the design, wording, and visuals, developers can create a more cohesive and engaging user experience.
    
2. **Improved engagement**üë•üìà: Custom install prompts can increase user engagement by providing additional information about the app's benefits and features. By highlighting the value proposition of the app, users are more likely to install it.
    
    * According to Google, websites that use a custom install prompt for their PWA can see up to a 5x increase in user engagement and up to a 6x increase in the number of users who add the app to their home screen compared to websites that do not use a custom prompt.
        
    * In a case study, Lanc√¥me saw a 53% increase in conversions and a 17% increase in `add-to-homescreen` rates after implementing a custom install prompt for their PWA.
        
    * Another case study by MakeMyTrip, an Indian online travel company, saw a 3x increase in `add-to-homescreen` rates and a 2.8x increase in user engagement after implementing a custom install prompt for their PWA.
        
    * These statistics show that custom install prompts can have a significant impact on user engagement and install rates for PWAs, making them a valuable tool for app developers and website owners to consider.
        
3. **Branding**üè∑Ô∏èüåê: Custom install prompts allow developers to showcase their brand and create a more memorable user experience. By aligning the prompt with the branding of the app, users are more likely to remember and engage with it.
    

### Steps to Create a Custom Install Prompt üßë‚Äçüíª

Creating a custom install prompt for your PWA is a simple process. I'll be using one of my PWA [Comfort Space](https://github.com/Evozone/comfortspace) to add a custom install prompt. Here are the basic steps:

1. **Listen for the** `beforeinstallprompt` **event & save itüõ†Ô∏è** - The `beforeinstallprompt` event, is fired when the browser determines that the app is installable. You can add event listeners to this event to create and show the prompt. The `beforeinstallprompt` event is fired when the browser detects that the PWA meets the installability criteria. The `event` object contains a `prompt()` method that shows the default install prompt. However, you can prevent this default behaviour by calling the `preventDefault()` method on the event object. You can then store the `event` object for later use usage.
    
    ```javascript
    const [supportsPWA, setSupportsPWA] = useState(false);
    const [promptInstall, setPromptInstall] = useState(null);
    
    useEffect(() => {
        const handler = (e) => {
            e.preventDefault();
            setSupportsPWA(true);
            setPromptInstall(e);
        };
        window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', handler);
    }
    ```
    
2. **Check if the PWA is already installed‚úÖ** - Before showing the install prompt, you should check if the PWA is already installed on the user's device. If it is, you can hide the install button. You can use the `window.matchMedia` method to check if a PWA is already installed on the user's device.
    
    ```javascript
    const onInstallClick = () => {
        if (!supportsPWA) {
            alert(
                'Either you have already installed the app or your browser does not support PWA :('
            );
            return;
        }
        promptInstall.prompt();
    };
    
    const renderInstallOption = () => {
        if (window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches) {
            return;
        } else {
            return (
                <div id="custom-install-prompt">
                    <img src="https://example.com/pwa-icon.png" alt="PWA Icon">
                    <h2>Install MyApp</h2>
                    <p>Get instant access to MyApp from your home screen.</p>
                    <button onClick={onInstallClick} id="install-btn">Install</button>
                    <button id="dismiss-btn">Dismiss</button>
                </div>
            );
        }
    };
    ```

3. **Customize the promptüé®** - You can customize the prompt by adding your wording, styling, and design. You can also provide additional information about the app to encourage the user to install it. You can check the `else` block of the above code snippet.
    

### Best Practices for Custom Install Prompts üèÜüìö

While custom install prompts can be a powerful tool to increase user engagement and install rates, there are a few best practices to keep in mind:

1. Timing‚è∞ - Custom install prompts should be triggered at the right time to maximize their effectiveness. Users are more likely to install the app when they are engaged with it. You should avoid showing the prompt too early or too late in the user journey.
    
2. Clarityüí° - Custom install prompts should be clear and concise. They should clearly communicate the value proposition of the app and provide a simple call-to-action to install it.
    
3. Customizationüé® - Custom install prompts should be customized to match the branding and design of the app or website. This helps to create a more memorable user experience and increase brand awareness.
    
4. Respect user preferencesü§ù - Custom install prompts should respect the user's preferences. If the user dismisses the prompt or has already installed the app, you should not show the prompt again. You can use `localStorage` to save the user's preference and avoid showing the prompt again.
